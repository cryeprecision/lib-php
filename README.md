# php for Unikraft

## Need to replace `lwip/include/netinet/tcp.h` with `modified_lwip_tcp.h` for some unknown reason.

This is the port of php for Unikraft as external library.

Please refer to the [`README.md`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/README.md)
as well as the documentation in the [`doc/`](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/doc/)
subdirectory of the main unikraft repository.
